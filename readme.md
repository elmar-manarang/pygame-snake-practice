Pygame snake based on tutorial found on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU&ab_channel=ClearCode
The goal is for me to learn python by following a tutorial plus adding additional features and cleanup

Libraries needed:
- Python 3.9.0
- Pygame 2.0.1

To run the game, just run `python main.py`

TODO:
- main screen (start)
- pause the game when the game just starts (DONE)
- game over
    - pause the game
    - change snake head to ded
    - add a button for restart (DONE)
- options
    - volume slider
    - other random configs
- issues:
    - fix issue with the snake head going outside or going in the snake on game over
    - fix issue with the control being unresponsive
